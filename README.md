# ATT-hotspot-data-usage
Python scraping script that retrieves how much data you've used and the date when it restarts. I use this with my prepaid ATT mobile hotspot account.

If you check your data usage at www.paygonline.com, then this can automate that for you and scrape the data.

# Usage
Enter your login credentials in the script. I have it outputting to a DataRemaining.txt file. I use this as input for a MagicMirror module, but you can use it for whatever you want.
